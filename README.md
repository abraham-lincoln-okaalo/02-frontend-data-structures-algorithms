## Installation

To use the algorithms and data structures in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:`git clone https://github.com/abraham-lincoln-okaalo/02-frontend-data-structures-algorithms.git`

## Usage

The repository is organized into individual JavaScript files, each representing a specific algorithm or data structure. You can find the implementation of each algorithm or data structure in the corresponding file.To use a particular algorithm or data structure, you can either copy the code directly from the repository or import the desired file into your project.For example, if you want to use the `reverseString` algorithm, you can copy the code from the [01-reverse-string.js](01-reverse-string.js) file and use it in your project.Please note that these implementations are provided as examples and may not be optimized for all scenarios. It's recommended to understand the concepts behind each algorithm and data structure and adapt the code to suit your specific needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional algorithms and data structures that you would like to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the existing code style and include appropriate documentation.If you find any issues or bugs in the existing code, please open an issue on the repository. Your feedback and suggestions are valuable in improving the quality of this repository.
